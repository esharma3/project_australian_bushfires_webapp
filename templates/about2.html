        <h2>Public Health</h2>
        <p>As unprecedented bushfires continued to burn along Australia’s east coast, medical professionals warned of unpredictable and lasting consequences for public health. “I think for the population, what they feel, and the concern they have about this, is probably reasonable,” said Chris Moy, chair of the Australian Medical Association’s ethics and medico-legal committee. Moy said the lasting impact of the bushfires and “the concern with respect to the air quality” was founded. He said “there are people who are going to probably die from these conditions”, particularly those “right at the edge of lung capacity”.</p>
        <p>He said at this point, the best thing the public could do was follow “common sense” advice such as staying indoors and heeding warnings. However, as the season dragged on, there were “psychological aspects of being stuck inside”. David Caldicott, a consultant emergency physician at Calvary hospital in Canberra, had seen this first-hand over the past few days, as the Canberra region suffered its highest pollution day on record. He said there had “definitely been an uptick in people”. While he noted an increase in elderly patients, asthmatics and those with other respiratory issues, he said the “psychiatric element associated with the potential threat of fire is something that’s often forgotten when people are focusing on respiratory diseases”. “I don’t think you can underestimate the psychological impact of not just the smoke but the existential threat of fire,” he said. “Canberra’s memories are long ... There are people who are anxious and who are vulnerable at times of anxiety who are presenting, looking for reassurance.” Nigel Cooper, senior manager of programs at Asthma Australia, said: “One of the key things for us is that I don’t think we’ve actually ever seen anything like this before.” Asthma Australia is conducting a survey on the impacts of bushfire smoke on asthmatics.</p>

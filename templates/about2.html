        <h2>Public Health</h2>
        <p>As unprecedented bushfires continued to burn along Australiaâs east coast, medical professionals warned of unpredictable and lasting consequences for public health. âI think for the population, what they feel, and the concern they have about this, is probably reasonable,â said Chris Moy, chair of the Australian Medical Associationâs ethics and medico-legal committee. Moy said the lasting impact of the bushfires and âthe concern with respect to the air qualityâ was founded. He said âthere are people who are going to probably die from these conditionsâ, particularly those âright at the edge of lung capacityâ.</p>
        <p>He said at this point, the best thing the public could do was follow âcommon senseâ advice such as staying indoors and heeding warnings. However, as the season dragged on, there were âpsychological aspects of being stuck insideâ. David Caldicott, a consultant emergency physician at Calvary hospital in Canberra, had seen this first-hand over the past few days, as the Canberra region suffered its highest pollution day on record. He said there had âdefinitely been an uptick in peopleâ. While he noted an increase in elderly patients, asthmatics and those with other respiratory issues, he said the âpsychiatric element associated with the potential threat of fire is something thatâs often forgotten when people are focusing on respiratory diseasesâ. âI donât think you can underestimate the psychological impact of not just the smoke but the existential threat of fire,â he said. âCanberraâs memories are long ... There are people who are anxious and who are vulnerable at times of anxiety who are presenting, looking for reassurance.â Nigel Cooper, senior manager of programs at Asthma Australia, said: âOne of the key things for us is that I donât think weâve actually ever seen anything like this before.â Asthma Australia is conducting a survey on the impacts of bushfire smoke on asthmatics.</p>
